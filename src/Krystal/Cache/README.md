Cache component===============This component provides several services to manage caching functionality. Before we start using it, let's take a look at how to configure it first.# ConfigurationThe configuration is located under `cache` key. It takes an array of arguments that defines cache engine type with its options. Typically it looks like so:    cache => array(       'engine' => '....',       'options' => array(         // Here come engine options       )    )Now let's take a look at available engines with their associated options, before we start using the cache service.## FileThis engine stores cache data in a file. Its configuration looks as the following:    cache => array(       'engine' => 'file',       'options' => array(         // This path is recommended, but you're free to defined another one.         'file' => 'data/cache/cache.data',      )    )Also, there's a hidden default options which is called `auto_create`. By default its value is `true`. The option itself defines whether to create a cache file if it doesn't exist or not.## SQLThis engine stores cache data in SQL database. Its configuration looks as the following:    cache => array(       'engine' => 'sql',       'options' => array(          'connection' => '..connection name..',          'table' => 'cache_table'      )    )As you can see, it has only two options. The `connection` defines what connection to use (its name must be defined under `db` configuration) and the `table` option defines what table to use.The table will not be created automatically for you. You have to do that yourself. So, the table schema is located at `/vendor/Krystal/Cache/Sql/table-schema.sql`. you have to execute that file in your SQL terminal (or any other tool of your choice that you use to manage a database).# MemcachedIf you have Memcached installed, you can use it as engine as well. The configuration might look like as following:    'cache' => array(       'engine' => 'memcached',       'options' => array(          'servers' => array(             array('mem1.domain.com', 11211, 33),             array('mem2.domain.com', 11211, 67)          )       )    )## Another enginesIf you have installed something of this: WinCache, APC, XCache, you can use them as a cache engine. The following list represent their engine names.`wincache` - WinCache`apc` - APC`xcache` - XCacheThey have no options. Here's an example of defining configuration for WinCache:    'cache' => array(       'engine' => 'wincache'    )# UsageOnce configuration is done, you can start using a service. The service can be accessed in controllers, as a `cache` property, just like this:    public function someAction()    {       // if the count key exists, return its value, otherwise return null       $count = $this->cache->get('count', null);    }# Available methods## increment()    \Krystal\Cache\CacheEngineInterface::increment($key, $step = 1)Increments a numeric key in a cache. By default the step is 1.## decrement()    \Krystal\Cache\CacheEngineInterface::decrement($key, $step = 1)Decrements a numeric key in a cache. By default step is 1.## set()    \Krystal\Cache\CacheEngineInterface::set($key, $value, $ttl)Stores a key in a cache. The third `$ttl` arguments defines a lifetime in seconds.## get()    \Krystal\Cache\CacheEngineInterface::get($key, $default = false)Returns an entry from a cache. If one doesn't exist, then a value of the second argument is returned, which is false by default.## remove()    \Krystal\Cache\CacheEngineInterface::remove($key)Removes an entry from a cache. If successes then returns `true`, otherwise `false`.## has()    \Krystal\Cache\CacheEngineInterface::has($key)Determines whether cache key exist. Return boolean.## getAll()    \Krystal\Cache\CacheEngineInterface::getAll()Returns all cache data.
