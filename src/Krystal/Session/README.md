Session component================This component provides a service object to work with session data.# ConfigurationIn most, cases there's no need to configure the session service. But in case you want to change a default session handler and store all session data in a database or if you want to override default options for the cookies, you're free to do so. Now, let's take a look at what we can tweak.## Database handlerFirst of all, open framework's configuration file and find a line which describes session configuration. It looks like this:    session => array(       'handler' => 'native'    )And replace it with the following:    'session' => array(      'handler' => 'sql',      'options' => array(       'connection' => 'mysql',       'table' => 'sessions'       )    )This tells the session's service component to use a database handler instead of native one.Now let's de-construct that step by step.  The `handler` key defines a session handler. It can be either `native` or `sql`. The `options` key defines options for the handler. The SQL handler itself has two options : `connection` and `table`. The `connection` key defines the name of database connection to be used (it must be defined in `db` section), and the `table` key defines a table of the table that stores session data.Note, before you start using the database handler, you have to create a table first. It's structure is located at `/vendor/Krystal/Session/Adapter/sql.schema.sql`. You have to execute that file first in SQL manager of your choice.## Cookie parametersTo override default cookie parameters, you'd create a key name `cookie_params` right after `handler`. It would look as following:    session => array(       'handler' => 'native',       'cookie_params' => array(          // Options can be set here       )    )Possible options are (taken from docs):`lifetime` - Lifetime of the session cookie, defined in seconds. Must be an integer.`path` - Path on the domain where the cookie will work. Use a single slash ('/') for all paths on the domain. `domain` - Cookie domain, for example 'www.php.net'. To make cookies visible on all subdomains then the domain must be prefixed with a dot like '.php.net'. `secure` - If `true` cookie will only be sent over secure connections.`httponly` - If set to `true` then PHP will attempt to send the `httponly` flag when setting the session cookie. # Working with sessionTo work with session data, you can access its service called `sessionBag` in controllers, just like this:    public function someAction()    {        $this->sessionBag->set('foo', 'bar');    }The session's service has a number of useful methods to work with a session. It's time to explore them.## set()\Krystal\Session\SessionBag::set($key, $value)Stores a key and its value in the session.## get()    \Krystal\Session\SessionBag::get($key, $default = false)Returns key's value from the session. In case a key doesn't exist, then default value is returned (which is `false` by default).## has()    \Krystal\Session\SessionBag::has($key)Determines whether session key has been set. Returns boolean.## remove()    \Krystal\Session\SessionBag::remove($key)Removes session value by its associated key, If a key doesn't exist, then `RuntimeException` will be thrown.## removeAll()    \Krystal\Session\SessionBag::removeAll()Removes all data from the session.## getAll()    \Krystal\Session\SessionBag::getAll()Returns all data from the session.## isValid()    \Krystal\Session\SessionBag::isValid()Checks if the session is valid. This test is based on IP + Browser of the current user, so it can be used to prevent session hijacks.## regenerate()    \Krystal\Session\SessionBag::regenerate()Regenerates session id.## setName()    \Krystal\Session\SessionBag::setName($name)Defines new session name.## getName()    \Krystal\Session\SessionBag::getName()Returns session name.## setId()    \Krystal\Session\SessionBag::setId($id)Defines new session id.## getId()    \Krystal\Session\SessionBag::getId()Returns unique session id.
