# Krystal Framework

I’ve worked with many popular PHP frameworks over the years, and I kept running into the same problems:

-   Overcomplicating simple tasks
-   Tight coupling between components
-   Steeper-than-necessary learning curves
-   Missing basic tools and components
-   Overly bloated documentation
-   Dozens of unnecessary dependencies you’ll never actually use
    

I created **Krystal Framework** to solve these issues.

**Why Choose Krystal Framework?**

-   **Insanely simple API**  
    Simplicity is at the heart of Krystal. The API is designed to be as clear and intuitive as possible, so you can focus on building, not deciphering.
    
-   **MVC done right**  
    Krystal delivers a precise MVC implementation with a dynamic routing system and controller-based architecture.  
    There are no heavy models or ActiveRecord patterns—models are composed of data mappers and service objects for clean, maintainable code.
    
-   **Built-in code generator**  
    Kickstart development with Krystal’s built-in code generator, making repetitive tasks effortless.

**Components**

-   **Routing & Controllers**  
    Simple yet powerful—routes are defined with a straightforward array and mapped directly to controller actions.
    
-   **Powerful Grid**  
    Create beautiful, data-rich tables with built-in filtering, sorting, and pagination—no extra setup required.
    
-   **Membership**  
    The built-in membership module includes all the essentials: login, registration, and password recovery.
    
-   **Image Tools**  
    Crop, resize, generate thumbnails, batch compress, and convert JPGs to AVIF or WebP—quickly and easily.
    
-   **Administration panel**  
    A fully pre-configured admin panel comes ready to use, complete with authentication and an RBAC (role-based access control) system.
    

**...and much more!**
